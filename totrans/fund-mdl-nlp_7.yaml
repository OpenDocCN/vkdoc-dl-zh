- en: Foundation Models emerged as a new paradigm in sequence interpretation that
    can be used for a large number of tasks to understand our environment. They offer
    the remarkable property of combining sensory input (sound, images, video) with
    symbolic interpretation of text and may even include action and DNA sequences.
    We briefly recap the process of pre-training, fine-tuning or prompting of Foundation
    Models and summarize their main properties. For the different application areas
    presented in the book, we summarize the performance levels of the models and delineate
    different promising economic applications. A section is devoted to discussing
    the potential harm that can be caused by Foundation Models, including bias, fake
    news, but also possible economic monopolies and unemployment. There is an urgent
    need for a legal regulation of the construction and deployment of these models.
    The last section considers advanced artificial intelligence systems and the shortcomings
    of current systems. Foundation Models have significantly improved performance
    in recent years and have the potential to reduce the gap to a truly general AI.

    sequences of different types. They evolved from Pre-trained Language Models (PLM)
    modeling the joint distribution of discrete tokens of written language. For these
    tokens, embeddings were derived in different layers by self-attention, which could
    flexibly and deeply characterize the meaning of the tokens in a context. Subsequently,
    these token embeddings can be used for downstream tasks.'

    tubelets in videos, events in game trajectories, etc. After tokenization, these
    sequences can be processed in the same way as text sequences. When different media
    types are ingested together, e.g. an image and the corresponding textual description,
    the relationship between words and visual contents is automatically acquired from
    the data. It seems that most aspects of our world can be represented as sequences.
    This justifies the claim that Foundation Models are a crucial paradigm for processing
    and interpreting most phenomena in our world. A comprehensive survey on the opportunities
    and risks of these models has been presented by Bommasani et al.[[13](#CR13)].

    et al. [[70](#CR70)]. They turned out to offer excellent solutions for natural
    language processing, such as translating a sentence into another language or checking
    whether two sentences are semantically equivalent.'

    the model was pre-trained on a non-specific big collection of natural language
    documents to acquire general knowledge about the language. By *self-supervised
    learning*, parts of a text were predicted using the remaining text as input. This
    opened up the opportunity to process vast amounts of text from books and the Internet
    to train the models. In the second step, the model was fine-tuned with a few-thousand
    manually annotated sentences to solve a specific task, such as determining, whether
    a movie review expresses a positive sentiment. The approach worked extremely well,
    showing that the models have the capability to detect subtle semantic properties
    of language. This two-step procedure was called *transfer learning*. After extensive
    experimentation, it was found that these models worked better the bigger they
    became and the more data their training sets contained.

- en: Knowledge in PLMs is stored by a huge number of parameters. Parameters contain
    the recipe to compute *embeddings* for the input tokens of the models. Embeddings
    are long vectors of real numbers and provide a way to represent the knowledge
    associated with the tokens. During training, a model implicitly defines a representation
    space that determines the meaning of embeddings. Usually, embeddings are assigned
    to tokens, i.e. parts of words, but may also be determined for paragraphs and
    complete documents. If two embeddings have a small vector distance, the meaning
    of the underlying tokens is similar. Foundation Models generate increasingly refined
    embeddings in their layers by taking into account the context of the tokens. The
    word *“bank”* close to the word *“money”* has a different embedding than a *“bank”*
    close to the word *“river”*, making the embeddings *contextual*. These effects
    also apply to tokens of different media types.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Embeddings are calculated by *self-attention* computing correlations between
    linear projections of input embeddings. This is done in parallel by multiple linear
    projections (attention heads), which create refined embeddings used as input for
    the next layer. Together with feedforward layers, attention modules form the basic
    building blocks of all types of PLMs. In spite of the investigation of many alternatives,
    this basic module is extremely effective and has not been changed during the last
    years.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Since the presentation of the basic Transformer, many improvements have been
    proposed and studied. Modified pre-training tasks, such as masking sequences or
    restoring permuted words, acquire deeper knowledge about the language. Another
    effort was devoted to increasing the length of the input sequence to capture longer
    contexts. By introducing sparse attention schemes, the quadratic growth of the
    computational effort was reduced to linear. A major achievement has been the extension
    of the models to multilingual settings, so that today many models simultaneously
    work with different languages and can transfer knowledge from resource-rich languages
    to rare languages.

    data and computational effort increased accordingly, the performance of the models
    also increased. For example, given a starting text, they could generate new stories
    in grammatically correct and fluent language reflecting a lot of common sense
    knowledge. Humans found it extremely difficult to distinguish these stories from
    genuine human stories.

    with a specific topic. The model could be supported to solve the task by a number

    for other types of sequences, including image patches, sound bites in audio recordings,
    3D tubelets in videos, DNA subsequences, and event trajectories in video games.
    It turned out that the same models could be applied to these sequences, associating
    the respective “tokens” with contextual embeddings that capture their meaning.
    Moreover, the relation to other token types, especially language tokens, was automatically
    taken into account in a mutually supportive way. This opened the door to a wide
    range of mixed media applications, e.g. image captioning, image generation, video
    description, video generation, image manipulation, etc. It was even possible to
    solve planning tasks with slightly modified models of this type.

    by self-attention has emerged as an overarching principle for solving a variety
    of different tasks. In 2021 Bommasani et al. [[13](#CR13), p. 6] coined the term
    “*Foundation Models*” to capture the significance of the underlying paradigm shift.
    They argue that the notion of “language models” is too narrow, as the scope extends
    far beyond language. A good characterization would be “task-agnostic model” as
    the approach is applicable to many types of sequences. “Foundation Model” is similar,
    since it emphasizes the common basis for many task-specific adaptions. It also
    suggests the need for an architectural stability, safety, and security. Usually
    Foundation Models have billions of parameters, because, for example, the adequate
    response to prompts occurs only in models of this size.

    Models. The models can ingest sequences with different media, as long as they
    can be converted to discrete tokens. This covers language and various media, but
    also structured data and the trajectories of control variables. During training,
    parts of the data must be reconstructed in a self-supervised way. Advanced Foundation
    Models have access to a search engine that can retrieve actual information for
    the currently processed content. In addition, the search engine can also store
    information, for example, about the facts learned during a dialog. For application,
    the Foundation Model can be fine-tuned for specific tasks, or it can be directed
    with few-shot learning to execute instructions. If it was trained with multiple
    media, it can translate between these media, for example generate an image according
    to a caption.![](../images/528393_1_En_8_Chapter/528393_1_En_8_Fig1_HTML.png)

    the next word in a text. This has to obey grammatical correctness as well as semantic
    consistency. The *LAMBADA benchmark* [[66](#CR66)] is a good test to demonstrate
    this ability (Sect. [4.​1.​3](528393_1_En_4_Chapter.xhtml#Sec4)). The task is
    to predict the missing last word of the last sentence of a longer passage. Examples
    were filtered by humans to ensure that the models need to take into account the
    full passage of at least 50 tokens to induce the final word. PaLM with 540B parameters
    with few-shot instructions could increase the accuracy to 89.7% [[24](#CR24),
    p. 79]. This means that in nearly nine out of ten cases the predicted word was
    exactly right, although several answers were possible in each case.

    a few natural language understanding benchmarks, e.g. GLUE and SuperGLUE (Sect.
    [4.​1.​1](528393_1_En_4_Chapter.xhtml#Sec2)), actual models with hundreds of billions
    of parameters usually are tested with test collections containing hundreds of
    different benchmarks. An example is the *BIG-bench benchmark* (Sect. [4.​1.​4](528393_1_En_4_Chapter.xhtml#Sec5))
    with currently more than 200 benchmarks from diverse fields such as analogical

    number of tasks showed discontinuous improvements from model scale, meaning that

    correct, but only somehow plausible. This reflects the internal mechanics of self-attention,
    which just computes correlations between tokens. Recently, models such as WebGPT,
    Retro, and LaMDA perform a database or web query on the current topic and are
    able to incorporate information from retrieved documents into the generated text
    (Sect. [3.​4.​5](528393_1_En_3_Chapter.xhtml#Sec22)). In this way, the correctness
    of the generated text can be profoundly enhanced. It is even possible to explain
    the answers by citing relevant documents. Especially helpful for multistep reasoning
    is the provision of a ‘chain of thoughts’ that encourages the Foundation Model

    there is a relation to a second argument. The resulting F1-values are usually
    in the high eighties, exceeding the performance of pre-PLM approaches. Most current
    relation extraction systems use relatively small BERT variants for their experiments.
    Therefore, it can be assumed that larger models will increase performance. In
    addition, Foundation Models such as GPT-3 and PaLM can be fine-tuned and achieve
    high accuracy even for few-shot prompts. However, relation extraction has not

    people, such as their personality, preferences, appearance, or abilities. Stereotypes
    are sometimes correct for part of the group, but can demean the rest of the group.
    It is known from psychology that bias is an innate human strategy for decision-making
    [[46](#CR46)]. It allows the rapid formation of a judgment in reality, when there
    is not much time to weigh arguments. As Foundation Models are trained with text
    produced by real people, these texts often reflect the stereotypes present in
    the society. This is particularly serious for text generation systems such as
    dialog assistants and chatbots. Based on the principle of equality in human rights,
    a Foundation Model should avoid prejudices. For example, men and women should
    be equally likely to be associated with an occupation. Surveys on bias in NLP
    are provided by Garrido-Muñoz et al. [[37](#CR37)], Mehrabi et al. [[57](#CR57)]

    race and occupation. By providing a start text like *“The detective was a”*, the

    The authors tested 388 occupations and found that 83% of them were associated
    by GPT-3 with a male identifier [[17](#CR17), p. 36]. In contrast, women clearly
    predominate in occupations such as midwife, nurse, receptionist, and housekeeper.

    was consistently associated with high mood, while Black race was related to low

    *“violent”*, *“terrorism”*, and *“terrorist”* were more frequently associated
    with Islam than with other religions. When GPT-3 is fed a sentence containing
    the word *“muslim”*, the completion contains terms such as *“shooting”*, *“bombing”*,
    *“murder”*, or *“violence”* more than 60% of the time. Such offensive, insulting
    or hateful language is also called *toxic language*. For example, for the input
    *“Islam practitioners are”*, the PaLM (Sect. [3.​1.​2](528393_1_En_3_Chapter.xhtml#Sec3))

    microaggressions, and stereotypes [[13](#CR13)]. After training, biases are contained
    in Foundation Model components, such as parameters and word embeddings. A first
    avenue to reduce bias is to filter or reweight the training data to eliminate
    unwanted language. According to a number of experimental evaluations, technical
    approaches of any kind are currently severely limited, and methods that measure
    or combat bias in training data are fragile or ineffective [[104](#CR104)]. Moreover,
    it is a difficult task to decide which biases to filter out. Is it okay for a
    man to run the 100 m faster than a woman? Is it okay that women cause less traffic

    terms in the training data when creating word embeddings [[102](#CR102)]. In addition,
    simple masking of pronouns and names may also reduce biases and improve performance
    on certain language tasks [[28](#CR28)]. These mitigation approaches may target
    different steps in the pipeline, such as the training data itself, the modeling
    objectives, and the adaptation methods [[13](#CR13), p. 133]. To date, however,
    there is no general, unified way to reduce the bias from Foundation Models for
    text generation, and proper mitigation requires a more holistic approach [[38](#CR38)].

    or jokes. In addition, training corpora are likely to contain instances of satire
    and misinformation, such as websites emphasizing a political stance. Furthermore,
    Foundation Models can have problems with logical reasoning and sometimes do not
    adhere to logical rules, e.g. if *“birds can fly”* is true, then *“birds cannot
    fly”* must be false (Sect. [4.​2.​3](528393_1_En_4_Chapter.xhtml#Sec10)). Finally,
    the context determines if a statement is true or not. The sentences *“I love you”*,
    *“it is raining”*, or *“Obama is president”* can be factually correct or false
    depending on the speaker, the location, or the time. The training data does not
    always define this context, and the context often cannot be captured by a Foundation
    Model. Context often requires to take into account knowledge of other domains

    approach is to fine-tune the model with biased training data, e.g. documents posted
    by Corona-deniers. Carlini [[20](#CR20)] discuss approaches to introduce unwanted
    documents into training data. Foundation Models predict higher likelihoods for
    concepts that are more prominent in the training data, regardless of whether they
    are factually correct. There are many examples of fine-tuning GPT-models (Sect.
    [3.​6.​2](528393_1_En_3_Chapter.xhtml#Sec40)) for more innocent text types, e.g.
    song lyrics [[100](#CR100)] or poetry [[52](#CR52)]. In a similar way GPT-2 trained

    for instance of far-right fake news [[18](#CR18), p. 14]. The resulting GPT-2

    news that they ‘like’ or that the provider deems “appropriate”, and therefore
    may find themselves in a ‘filter bubble’ where news that does not match the expressed

    do not know the criteria used to prioritize content. As a result, many citizens
    are calling for regulation of filtering algorithms, but drafting and enforcing
    regulations remains a challenge. A target of regulation may be, for instance,
    that the ads a user sees are not be based on sexual orientation, or that content
    related to COVID-19 does not reflect a user’s political affiliation [[23](#CR23)].

    school students who plagiarize change a couple words here or there but they’re
    not really putting the ideas together. It doesn’t really understand the underlying
    ideas.”* As argued above, GPT-3 cannot really “understand” the content it expresses,
    as it does not have a grounding for words and phrases by the objects and events
    in the real world.

    discussing the role of metafiction in the work of Italo Calvino.”* The system
    generated a concise five-paragraph summary on the topic. The author characterized
    the resulting text as “lucid and responsive”. When the prompt is repeated, GPT-3
    generates a completely new response over and over again. When the author entered
    each generated sentence into the Google search engine, he could not find any of
    them. Each sentence was custom-built for that specific prompt. This illustrates
    that Foundation Models are very good at combining pieces of contents together.
    However, they do not act on the level of strings and words, but on the level of
    contextual embeddings, which express the underlying conceptual similarity of phrases
    and sentences and their relation in a large number of sentences and documents.

    simultaneously capture text and image content. As described in Sect. [7.​2](528393_1_En_7_Chapter.xhtml#Sec12),
    models such as DALL-E 2 develop a joint embedding space for image patches and
    text tokens. In this space images and texts are not related in terms of pixels
    and strings, but in terms of context-sensitive embeddings of these image patches
    and tokens. These embeddings are different depending on the overall composition
    of the image and the text. Generating new content is based on the correlation
    of these embeddings and therefore can create new combinations of images and text,
    for instance an image corresponding to *“a corgi playing a flame throwing trumpet”*
    (Fig. [7.​15](528393_1_En_7_Chapter.xhtml#Fig15)) or photo-realistic images illustrating
    the caption *“A teddybear on a skateboard in Times Square”* (Fig. [7.​16](528393_1_En_7_Chapter.xhtml#Fig16)).
    Although DALL-E 2 does not know anything about the physical properties of the
    real-world location “Times Square”, it can combine information about it in terms
    of contextual embeddings and generate fairly realistic looking views that have
    never been seen before. In this way, Foundation Models can actually generate innovative
    content.

    the “meaning’ of language. Bender et al. [[8](#CR8)] argue that the “language
    modeling task, because it only uses linguistic forms as training data, cannot
    in principle lead to learning of meaning”. Here, “meaning” is defined as the relation
    between a linguistic form and the communicative intent in the real world. Language
    modeling in this context is a system for string prediction. According to this
    view, current language models do not acquire “meaning”, but relate phrases to
    other phrases.

    [8.5](#Fig5)). Parents and babies are pointing to objects during language development
    [[26](#CR26)], and babies learn the grounded meanings of words that refer to common
    objects before they learn many other aspects of language [[10](#CR10)]. The baby
    simply observes its environment and, probably, develops some expectation of how
    the environment (e.g. object movement, view change) will evolve over time (Fig.
    [8.6](#Fig6)). Seeing an apple fall a number of times is enough to get a sense
    of how gravity works. Moreover, objects do not disappear when they move out of
    sight. The baby can learn by predicting these changes and unconsciously correcting
    its expectations whenever a deviation occurs [[51](#CR51)]. This corresponds to
    unsupervised learning in the video domain by predicting the next frames. The NÜWA
    system (Sect. [7.​3.​4](528393_1_En_7_Chapter.xhtml#Sec27)) is already pre-trained

    A dog, for instance, is not entirely understood if one knows that it is connected
    to leashes, ears, cats, mammal, leg, fur, tail, toy, barking, etc. [[50](#CR50)].
    The information has to be structured so that people know that toys are things
    dogs play with, fur is their body covering, mammal is a category they fall into,
    and so on. The head of a dog near to four legs does not constitute a dog. Therefore,
    the best way to learn the concept of a dog is to perceive it in several media,
    for example, as an image, in a descriptive text, and in a movie, where it is chasing

    tracking over time. Using a violation-of-expectation criterion, PLATO can learn

    i.e. the systematic future-oriented consideration of goals, means, and ways to
    achieve goals in the future. This corresponds to Kahneman’s System 2\. The Foundation
    Model basically performs *model predictive control* and simulates the system under
    consideration for a series of time steps [[75](#CR75)]. An example is driving
    a car on a road. Here the system simultaneously simulates the state of the system
    (e.g. position and speed of the car), the actions (e.g. steering wheel movements,
    acceleration) and the reward (e.g. distance to goal, distance from obstacles).
    The Foundation Model is trained using a set of observed trajectories and can learn
    the dependency between states, actions and resulting rewards. Subsequently, it
    is able to predict the next action to reach a specific reward level. Planning
    with Foundation Models can already include multiple modalities, e.g. perform a
    control with images as state descriptions.

    that neural networks just cannot resolve and that we have to resort to the classical
    AI, symbolic approach. But our work suggests otherwise.” It is more probable that
    reasoning is performed by internal simulation and by analogy. As Geoffrey Hinton
    puts it: *“But my guess is in the end, we’ll realize that symbols just exist out
    there in the external world, and we do internal operations on big vectors”* [[39](#CR39)].

    is dynamically configurable for the task at hand [[96](#CR96)]. In this way, knowledge
    about how the environment works may be shared across tasks. A key requirement
    is that the world model must be able to represent and compare multiple possible
    predictions of the environment. This configurator has the ability to combine different
